# Polka Native Storage pallet

This is the main pallet which implements the native storage interface for the Polka Native project. It is the entry point for the users which can call it from the other parachains.

Our intention is to provide a simple and easy to use interface for the users. That's why this pallet consists of extrinsics and RPC calls mainly assosiated with the storage from the user's perspective.
